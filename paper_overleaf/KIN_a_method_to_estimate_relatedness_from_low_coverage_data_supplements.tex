    \caption{Comparison of fit with Beta-binomial and Binomial distributions. Data is represented by the histogram of proportion of differences from all windows of a (A) unrelated, (B) Parent-Child, (C) Identical pair of individuals. Binomial parameter p is calculated from the data, while Beta-binomial parameters are estimated with the relatedness HMM.}

    \caption{Overview of simulated dataset. (A) We simulated four different populations with split times and sampling times (in generations) mimicking the populations of Chagyrskaya Neandertals, Vindija Neandertals, Altai Neandertals and present day Africans \cite{mafessoni_high-coverage_2020}. We artificially mated individuals in Pop1 to create related individuals. We used Pop2 and Pop3 to introduced ascertainment bias in the data, while we simulated contamination from modern humans using Pop4. (B) In Pop1, we sampled 8 diploid unrelated individuals, and artificially mated some of them to make a pedigree with upto $5^th$ Degree relatives. Circles represent females, and squares represent males. Dotted lines connect identical pair of individuals.}

Color of a square represents the relatedness, while the number denotes standard deviations away from the upper threshold (we show lower threshold for unrelated pairs since upper threshold is not available).}

    \caption{Application of Identical KIN-HMM on a pair of identical individuals with low coverage (0.2x), and ROH tracts. Top panel shows pairwise proportion of differences is close to expectation, but dips in some windows due to presence of ROH tracts. Bottom two panels show $P(Data|Z_w=2)$ without constraints and with constraints respectively.}

Unrelated label here refers to KIN performance results when all Unrelated, Fifth Degree, Fourth Degree, Third Degree pairs are labelled as Unrelated. 'Unrelated w/o $3^{rd}$ Degree' refers to the performance results when $3^{rd}$ Degree is classified separately from the unrelated individuals.}

The y-axis shows accuracy calculated over 60 simulations for each relatedness case, for each scenario (control, C, A or R), and six different coverages shown on the x-axis. The error bars display one standard deviation from the mean. Here, accuracy corresponding to relatedness cases for Parent-Child and Identical individuals is always 1, and overlaps with each other.}

Each plot shows relatedness coefficient (calculated as $k_2+k_1/2$) on y-axis plotted against $k_0$ (proportion of genome with no chromosomes shared). The relatedness shown with different colors is estimated with both READ and KIN.}
